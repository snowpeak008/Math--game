"""Closed-form solvers for common idle/incremental game calculations.

These functions compute exact (or near-exact) answers for standard idle game
math problems without simulation. They use BigFloat for overflow-safe
game-scale arithmetic and scipy.optimize.brentq for higher-degree polynomial
root-finding.

Key formulas implemented:
- Geometric series for bulk purchase costs
- Logarithmic inverse for max-affordable calculations
- Generator chain production (t^n/n! for homogeneous rates)
- Polynomial time-to-afford via Brent's method
